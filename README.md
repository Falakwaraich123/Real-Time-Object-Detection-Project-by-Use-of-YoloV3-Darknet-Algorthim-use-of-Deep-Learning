# Real-Time-Object-Detection-Project-by-Use-of-YoloV3-Darknet-Algorthim-use-of-Deep-Learning
Abstract of Project
Real time object detection (YoloV3 and Dark-net Algorithms) is project is one of creative idea that was introduced CEO of LEITEK INNOVATIVE SOLUTION at Lisbon, Portugal.
In this project we deal with several type of objects detects to drone camera.We use a flying drown that integrated with web-based application.Drown use camera for live
streaming as well as use GPU for high resolution and communicated with web-based application that are developed open source plate form Flask of python.In this project we
deal 82 type of classes object like Person, Cycle and Car with help of dark net algorithm.Convolution Neural Network is backbone of dark net that are implemented and
specially designed for object detection.CNN have several hidden layers that are full connected to each other and neuron as passed the input and output in CNN model. 
CNN model is used deep learning approaches for training and testing of image classification with the help of tensor flow and keraâ€™s with own data set.
